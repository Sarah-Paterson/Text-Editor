# Text Editor

## Description

In this project, I worked with existing code provided by The Coding Bootcamp on GitLab. I was motivated to modify the existing code to create a progressive web application (PWA).

This website was created for the purpose of giving the user another text editing application option. It provides the opportunity to write snippets of code in a text editor. These will then be stored in a database to be accessed after closing and reopening the application. As a PWA application, this text editor will be faster, work offline, secure, and installable. 

Through the implementation of various development packages, I was able to modify the code to create a PWA application that works the same as the code originally provided but optimized and also downloadable to be used as a desktop application that can function online as well as offline.

I had many issues with this project that I'm still trying to work though. Most of it is set up the way I intended, yet the program isn't running correctly on my computer. My hope is to return to this project and modify it so that it works correctly.

[Here is the URL of the deployed application](https://rocky-fjord-21364-7a3054fb5079.herokuapp.com/).
