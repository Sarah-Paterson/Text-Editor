# Text Editor

## Description

In this project, I worked with existing code provided by The Coding Bootcamp on GitLab. I was motivated to modify the existing code to create a progressive web application (PWA).

This website was created for the purpose of giving the user another text editing application option. It provides the opportunity to write snippets of code in a text editor. These will then be stored in a database to be accessed after closing and reopening the application. As a PWA application, this text editor will be faster, work offline, secure, and installable. 

Through the implementation of various development packages, I was able to modify the code to create a PWA application that works the same as the code originally provided but optimized and also downloadable to be used as a desktop application that can function online as well as offline.

## PWA Elements

The key to this project was to utilize the working code provided and optimize it by converting it into a progressive web application (PWA). Here are the specifics about the elements that converted the original text editor application into a PWA application.
